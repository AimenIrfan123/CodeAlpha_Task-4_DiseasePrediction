# Task 4 – Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts diseases based on symptoms using machine learning algorithms. It helps users input their symptoms and get the most likely disease as output.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Tkinter (for GUI)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

2. Run the main file:
   python gui.py

3. Enter symptoms in the interface to get the disease prediction.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains symptoms and their corresponding diseases used to train machine learning models like Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

## 📌 Features
- Predicts diseases based on multiple symptoms.
- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Uses multiple ML models for better accuracy.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is developed for **Task 4 submission** to demonstrate the application of machine learning in healthcare.
